Restaurant reviews are written feedback or comments shared by customers based on their dining experiences at restaurants. These reviews typically reflect opinions on food quality, service, ambiance, pricing, and overall satisfaction.In this project, we use restaurant reviews as text data to perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The aim is to classify whether a review is positive (liked) or negative (not liked) using machine learning techniques.

Data At Hand:
The Restaurant Reviews dataset contains 1,000 customer reviews about various restaurants, along with sentiment labels indicating whether the review is positive (1) or negative (0). Each review represents a real-world opinion that captures aspects such as food quality, service, ambiance, and overall customer satisfaction.This dataset is commonly used for sentiment analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, where the goal is to classify the sentiment of a review using machine learning models.

This dataset is all about restaurant reviews. It contains:

Dataset Format:
File Type: .tsv (Tab-Separated Values)

Columns:
Review: Textual review written by a customer.
Liked: Target label (1 = Positive, 0 = Negative)
This dataset provides a practical foundation for building models that understand and classify human sentiments based on natural language.

This project implements a sentiment analysis system to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.
The solution follows a structured NLP pipeline including text preprocessing, TF-IDF based feature extraction, and supervised classification with multiple models.A detailed explanation of the methodology, results, and analysis is provided in the accompanying project report (PDF).

Key Highlights:

Text preprocessing using NLTK (cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization)
TF-IDF vectorization with unigram and bigram features
Model training and tuning using:
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Model evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix
Interpretability through analysis of sentiment-indicative words

Tech Stack:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Project Artifacts:

Restaurant_Reviews.tsv – Dataset

sentiment_analysis.ipynb / .py – Implementation

Restaurant_Sentiment_Analysis.pdf – Detailed project report

Outcome:
The project demonstrates a reproducible and interpretable sentiment analysis pipeline suitable for real-world customer feedback analysis.
